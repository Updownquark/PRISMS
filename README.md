# PRISMS
The Plugin Remote Integrated Service Management System

This was a web server architecture behind a servlet container that managed plugins and properties.  Development on has been stopped for many years.

I later used it as a repo for general tools I created, but these have been moved to Qommons.

This repo is no longer in use or maintained.  It may be considered deprecated.
